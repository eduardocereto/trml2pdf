<h3>About this document</h3>

<h2>History and Status</h2>

<p>This is the test suite and docoumentation for the ReportLab open source barcode API, being re-released as
part of the forthcoming ReportLab 2.0 release.</p>
<p>Several years ago Ty Sarna contributed a barcode module to the ReportLab community. Several of the codes
were used by him in hiw work and to the best of our knowledge this was correct. These were written as
flowable objects and were available in PDFs, but not in our graphics framework. However, we had no
knowledge of barcodes ourselves and did not advertise or extend the package.</p>
<p>We "wrapped" the barcodes to be usable within our graphics framework; they are now available as Drawing
objects which can be rendered to EPS files or bitmaps. For the last 2 years this has been available in our
Diagra and Report Markup Language products. However, we did not charge separately and use was on an "as
is" basis.</p>
<p>A major licensee of our technology has kindly agreed to part-fund proper productisation of this code on an
open source basis in Q1 2006. This has involved addition of EAN codes as well as a proper testing program.
Henceforth we intend to publicise the code more widely, gather feedback, accept contributions of code and
treat it as "supported".</p>
<p>This involved making available both downloads and testing resources. This PDF document is the output of
the current test suite. It contains codes you can scan (if you use a nice sharp laser printer!), and will be
extended over coming weeks to include usage examples and notes on each barcode and how widely tested
they are. This is being done through documentation strings in the barcode objects themselves so should
always be up to date.</p>

<h3>Usage examples</h3>

<p>To be completed</p>

<h3>The code</h3>

<p>Below we show a scannable code from each barcode, with and without human-readable text. These are
magnified about 2x from the natural size done by the original author to aid inspection. This will be expanded
to include several test cases per code, and to add explanations of checksums. Be aware that (a) if you enter
numeric codes which are too short they may be prefixed for you (e.g. "123" for an 8-digit code becomes
"00000123"), and that the scanned results and readable text will generally include extra checksums at the
end.
